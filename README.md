# Smart Types

A rewrite of the solc type system using custom data types, minimizing implicit behavior.

## TODO

- `ERCN` type around `address` for optimized ERC-related interactions without interfaces (in progress)
- `HashMap` type for memory hashmaps (todo)
- `Vec` type for memory vectors (todo)
- `Graph` recursive type for on-chain graph data structures (todo)
- `System` library for `Primitive` producing introspection opcodes (todo)

## Contributing

Contribution guide will follow upon the official `0.1.0` release.
